For posterity, documenting a bad year "per the numbers" ... 2020 was the
pandemic year when we didn't know what was going on. In hindsight, we should
have flew more but alas...

By the numbers,

* 31.1 hours total time
* The big trip was flying to `KHSR` - a great airport in Black Hills, South
Dakota. I haven't wrote a PIREP about this airport yet...
* Managed to do a volunteer flight for a LifeLine Pilots mission
* Mostly flying to stay current
