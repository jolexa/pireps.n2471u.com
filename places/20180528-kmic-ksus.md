### May 26-28, 2018 KSUS Spirit of St Louis (Chesterfield), MO

Origin: KMIC  
Destination: KSUS  
Total Logged Time: 8.8 hours  
Approximately 4.0-4.4 hours _in air_ each way  

Yay. Our first multi-stop, multi-day cross country flight! What a great
experience! Highlights include:
* Great VFR weather for both legs, no delays.
* Watching a F-18 land in front of us. Wow!
* While the F-18 was landing, a vintage Stearman getting ready to take-off
* Taking the niece and nephews flying for the first time   
* VFR Flight Following the entire trip, working with ATC in busy airspaces and
getting Bravo transitions.
* It isn't scary to take a longish cross country, just a series of smaller
cross-countries.
* Amazing co-pilot to share the trip! We are a good team!

PIREPS:  
**KAWG** (Washington, IA): This was our mid-way fuel stop. Sleepy airport, saw two
other small airplanes in or around the area. Cheap fuel, good pumps, spacious
ramp. Mediocre FBO ramp, but served it purpose.  
**KSUS** (Chesterfield, MO): Spirit of St Louis. This was a typical large,
_full-service_ airport/FBO. There was several vintage airplanes around and I
think it might be normal per the A/FD descriptions. We utilized
[TACAir](http://tacair.com/) and had no complaints. There was self-service fuel
on the field which was about as expensive as full service at home.  
**KFYG** (Washington, MO): This is the airport we flew to and took the family
for rides. We choose this because it was more low-key and easier more "friendly"
for our needs and multiple start/stops.  
**55Y** (Rushford, MN): We choose this as our "past mid-way" fuel stop. Super
cheap fuel and nice facilities for a rural airport. Very unique approach too,
we didn't expect to see the rolling cliffs in MN around this airport. We want to
go back and explore the area in the future.


VFR Proposed routing, navigating VORs enroute.

Start of many F-18 shots. Apparently TAC Air at KSUS has a nice agreement with
different governments. This particular plane was from Canada. Something like
2100 gallons of fuel!

On Sunday, we went to a quieter airport (KFYG) on the edge of town and took all
the kids (and adults) for 20 minute rides. They loved it!
