### May 12, 2018 KTWM Two Harbors, MN

Origin: KMIC  
Destination: KTWM  
Total Logged Time: 3.5 hours  
Approximately 1.5 hours _in air_ each way  

We went to Two Harbors, MN to goto our friend's cabin. KTWM is a great municipal
airport. Very nice runway/taxiways, very nice people, relatively cheaper fuel,
free tiedowns. A+. One of the best parts was that you can _reserve_ a courtesy
car for $20/day and keep is overnight if desired. I can easily see us using this
airport again as a launching point for a camping trip. Here are a few pictures
below.

Proposed VFR route northbound

Not everyday you hear: "Please turn 10 degrees right to avoid _**rocket**
activity_"!!

Duluth

All tied up, only airplane on the ramp. Which one of the 20 spots do you want?
