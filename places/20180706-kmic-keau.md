### July 6, 2018 KEAU (Eau Claire, WI)

Origin: KMIC  
Destination: KEAU (Eau Claire, WI)  
Total Logged Time: x.y (round trip)

I went solo to Eau Claire on a VFR day, completely IFR rules for a practice run.
Being solo, I can't count any of this flight for IFR currency, but I had the day
off work and it was a good flying day, so I went for lunch.

This is the IFR route to KEAU

The actual route, looks pretty close. I did the ILS 22 Approach

The restaurant is located here, it will be marked on the outside of the
terminal. Or you can ask ground control, like I did.
