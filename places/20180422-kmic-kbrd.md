Terminal at the ramp on Brainerd Lakes Regional Airport. The terminal is on the

Nice little cafe! Check out their website, apparently some coffee/cafe has been
there for ages. Below are all the pictures of the trip. I met with Leah and
Kyle, the plan was to go somewhere else but they were closed so I pulled this
trip out of my hat. It was a straight shot from KMIC and _very uneventful
flight_, some chop at 4500 and below, smooth above. Beautiful spring day. At the
end of the flight, KMIC Tower gladly let us come up for a quick tour, pretty
cool to see ATC work! I appreciate ATC and what they do for our Airspace System,
it is nice to put a name with a voice.


Direct Routing, many VFR Targets but no factor.

Cafe was packed! We had to wait for a table. There are so many regulars at this
place. Everyone knows Kimmy!

I'm guessing you flew here for all-day breakfast. We did! Beware, this cafe is
closed around 2-3pm.
