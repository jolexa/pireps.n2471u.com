### September 8, 2018 KBRD Poker Run Brainerd Area, MN

Origin: KMIC  
Destination: KBRD 9Y0 07Y 52Y 9Y2  
Total Logged Time: 4.8 hours

This was a fun event. We would probably never goto these grass strips without
some event like this. The event was a "Poker Run" -- where you pick up a card
for your poker hand at each airport then the highest hand wins. It is not a
race.

Highlights:
* Great VFR weather for all legs, slight crosswind at one airport but otherwise
prevailing winds at the rest of the airports.
* Navigating 30+ aircraft all flying around the same airports in different
paths.
* Meeting random people in small aircraft, enjoying the sport.
* Third place winning hand! $100 gift card to [Madden's on Gull Lake](https://www.maddens.com/).
Yay, flying date in our future.
* Amazing co-pilot to share and help my navigate!

PIREPS:  
**KBRD** (Brainerd, MN): I've been to Brainard [before](/places/20180422-kmic-kbrd.md), nice place.  
**09Y** (Bowstring, MN): This was our favorite airport on the circuit. The FBO
was a old trailer home and the airport manager (and other volunteers) made us
breakfast sandwiches.  
**07Y** (Hill City, MN): Nothing much here, nice field, few hangars.  
**52Y** (Remer, MN): Nothing much here, nice field.  
**9Y2** (East Gull Lake, MN): This strip is right on the golf course, good
airport to stop at if you are going to some of the resorts or restaurants.  

VFR Direct, early in the morning

Not everyday you see a group of small planes marching out to the runway. We had
a business jet behind us, I bet they were talking about everyone!

Everyone off! We were in a _small_ group heading to Bowstring. We chose to go to
the farthest one first instead of making a circle like everyone else

I didn't take many photos, if you have seen one grass strip, you have seen them
all! :smile:
