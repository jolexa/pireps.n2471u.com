### September 6, 2018 18Y (Milaca, MN)

Origin: KMIC  
Destination: 18Y (Milaca, MN)

I went solo to Milaca for a practice run on a grass field. I haven't actually
landed on grass for a few years and even though I knew _how_ to land, I still
wanted to practice before the [KBRD Poker Run](/places/20180908-kbrd-poker-run).

**18Y** is one of the nicer grass fields in MN, well maintained and _relatively_
cheap fuel on the field. I didn't stop in the FBO this time but may in the
future.

Check out the picture of wild turkeys on the edge of the runway and the amazing
sunset back home.
