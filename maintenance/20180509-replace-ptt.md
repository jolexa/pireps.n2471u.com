### May 9, 2018 Replace PTT on Yoke

The Push-to-Talk (PTT) switch needed to be replaced because it was intermittent.
As long as you know the proper part, it is pretty simple. About a 15 minute job.

This is what the PTT switch looks like on the yoke.

Basically, the switch was intermittent. I had one thing on my mind: "How do I
verify that the _switch_ is faulty before trying to repair it?"  
So, I took the switch out, I saw that it was soldered to the wires which lead to
relays behind the panel. At this point, I was feeling confident that the switch
was _actually_ faulty based on ground testing. I took a leap of faith and cut
the wires, then verified that the relay was predictably engaging when the wires
were shorted.

After the above, I just had to find the dang part! I ordered two in case it
I screwed up or needed to source another one (I also ordered a soldering iron).  
The part number `487-904` proved to be the magic search.

After some soldering, it worked.
