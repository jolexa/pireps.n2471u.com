### April 17, 2019 Replace Landing Light

The ubiquitous GE 4509 100w Landing Light needed to be replaced. The 4509 has a
rated life span of 25 (!!) hours - not very long. Though we can't be sure, we
may have got good life out of the bulb - lasting longer than expected. But,
still, 25 hours! Pathetic. It is worth the $12 price tag, but not worth our time
to replace so often.

Fortunately, it is an easy drop-in upgrade to a LED bulb with _thousands_ of
hours expected. The new Whelen Parmetheus Plus P36P1L Landing Light should be a
lifetime purchase. There is a PMA from the manufacture, so this type of
replacement can be done by the owner in accordance with applicable FARs.

New bulb, pretty!

Connect existing wires. Instructions indicate which terminal is which. However,
per the instructions the bulb will not work if polarity is reversed, nor will it
be damaged. :+1:

Fit bulb into housing, honor the notches and it will seat in the existing space.
Instructions _indicate_ a drop in replacement, but I can see how some cowlings
might require modifications.

Ops check! :sunglasses:

Wrap up installation, by screwing the retaining housing back in.

Post installation, double check. This is the light output in a lighted hangar.
The top cowling is off for other work, it is not needed to take off for
replacing the landing light.
