### May 21, 2019 Replace ELT Battery

Every 2 years (approximately), the ELT Battery must be replaced. We have a
Narco ELT 10 model. Someday we may upgrade to the new 406Mhz ELT, but for now
this is what we have. The ELT battery replacement regulation is abit confusing,
but I have it boiled down to replace the battery after 1) one hour of cumulative
usage or 2) when the tag says (should be close to 2 years).

Fortunately, it is super easy to replace yourself.

The battery comes off the ELT and there is a small battery hookup wire

And, just like that. Reinstall and reset G switch and it is all good to go. I
turned on my radio to 121.50 and tested it at the proper time. All working.
